*** twitch-websockets

    A websockets event interface for Twitch.tv channels.

    Take a look at tmi-test.lisp for example usage.

*** Status

    I don't know of anything here that doesn't work but if you find something I'd love it if you'd open an issue.  I'll almost certainly add things, but I won't break the existing library.  An example for each event will be in tmi-test.lisp.
