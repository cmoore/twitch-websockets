*** twitch-websockets

    A websockets event interface for Twitch.tv channels.

    Take a look at tmi-test.lisp for example usage.

*** Status

    What's here, works and the API won't change.  I'll almost certainly add things, but I won't break the existing library.  An example for each event is in tmi-test.lisp.
